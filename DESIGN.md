## Core Exercise - Hotel Booking System

#### Epic

”A local hotel wants to keep a record of room bookings. The hotel has a lot of rooms, but **customers** will only be able to choose one room per booking. The person who books the room is not necessarily the person providing contact details.”

#### User Stories
- As a customer, so I can have a place to stay tomorrow night, I want to book a **room** at the **hotel**.
- As the hotel owner, so I can expand my business, I want to add new rooms to the hotel.

Design a simplified booking system for this epic.
